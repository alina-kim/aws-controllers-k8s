# Overview

This section of the docs is for ACK contributors.

The [code generation](../code-generation/) section gives you a bit of background
on how we go about automating the code generation for controllers and supporting
artifacts.

In the [setup](../setup/) section we walk you through setting up your local Git
environment with the repo and how advise you on how we handle contributions.

Last but not least, in the [testing](../testing/) section we show you how to
test ACK locally.
